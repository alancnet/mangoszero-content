This document tracks changes in the [mangos-zero database][113] and highlights
what has been done to bring the database to you.

0.2.0 (2014-08-31)
------------------
This is the first content release of the clean **mangos-zero** database, and it
features level 1 to 10 content for the following zones:

* Dun Morogh: starting zone for the Dwarf and Gnome races,
* Elwynn Forest: starting zones for the Human race,
* Teldrassil: starting zone for the Night Elf race,
* Durotar: starting zone for the Orc and Troll races,
* Mulgore: starting zone for the Tauren race,
* Tirisfal Glades: starting zone for the Undead race,

Please note that this content does not cover the faction home cities such as
*Darnassus*, *Ironforge*, *Stormwind*, *Orgrimmar*, *Thunderbluff* and the
*Undercity* other than the initial NPCs which are required to complete the
initial class specific quests, or the faction specific introductions.

0.1.1 (2014-07-22)
------------------
A bug fix release to address various issues.

* database structure has been synchronized with the current mangos-zero version,
* a few issues with scripting and content have been resolved,
* documentation has been updated for our new home on BitBucket.

0.1.0 (2013-09-23)
------------------
This marks the initial release of our database. A fresh database was crafted
with the ideal of creating clean, properly researched game content to you.

The initial release focusses on deliver an empty, usable world. This means:

* you can create characters of any race/class,
* you can travel the world by foot, and any available transportation such as
  ships or Zeppelins,
* you can die (and resurrect if needed)
* you can enter all instances.

Thus the release is not to be considered playable, it is more a playground for
content developers to build upon. Also this release was built to test drive
the update process, and to show best practices for crafting database updates.
